\begin{abstract}
LIO is a decentralized information flow control (DIFC) system,
implemented in Haskell.
%
In this demo proposal, we give an overview of the LIO library and
show how LIO can be used to build secure systems.
%
In particular, we show how to specify high-level security policies,
and describe how LIO automatically enforces these policies on
untrusted code.

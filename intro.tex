\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Haskell provides many language features that can be used to reduce the
damage caused by any particular piece of code.
%
Notable among these are the strong static type system and module
system.
%
The type system, in addition to reducing undefined behavior, can be
used to distinguish between pure and side-effecting computations,
i.e., computations that can and cannot affect the ``external world,''
while the module system can be used to enforce abstraction (e.g., by
restricting access to constructors).

\section{Demonstration}
\label{sec:demo}
The demonstration will explain the basics of DIFC and how LIO can be
used to enforce information flow security on untrusted code.
%
In particular, we will show how the core of simple, web-based
conference review system is implemented in LIO.
%
Part of this includes the specification of high-level policies, which
is facilitated by the use of a simple label model (DCLabels) and our
automatic labelling paradigm.
%
To demonstrate the flexibility of our automatic labeling we will show
how arbitrary untrusted code can be used to replace the core
busy-logic of the application.

\begin{abstract}
LIO is a decentralized information flow control (DIFC) system.
%
In this demo, we give an overview of the Haskell LIO library and show
how LIO can be used to build secure systems.
%
In particular, we show how to build secure web applications with
high-level data-security policies and describe how LIO automatically
enforces these policies.

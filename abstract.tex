\begin{abstract}
LIO is a decentralized information flow control (DIFC) system,
implemented in Haskell.
%
In this demo proposal, we give an overview of the LIO library and
show how LIO can be used to build secure systems.
%
In particular, we show how to specify high-level security policies for
in the context of web applications, and describe how LIO automatically
enforces these policies even in the presence of untrusted code.
